# Chroma-Keying-Color-Patch-Replace

The motivation behind this project was to replicate the green-screen replace technology found in many video processing and streaming applications, using Chroma Keying. I went a step further and implemented a function that allows the user to sample a patch of color to replace from the video. This means that the user is no longer restrained to only replacing green color. I also demonstrate a fun naive color replacing implementation where I change Vegeta, a famous anime character, from super-saiyan (yellow color aura) to super-saiyan rose (pink color aura).
